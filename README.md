# Receipt Analyzer App
This Android application was built for Duke's CS290.3 Mobile Software Development course. The website for this project is available [HERE](https://joycechoi19.github.io/receiptAnalyzerWebsite/). 

Our app aims to do 2 things:
1. Make your paper receipts electronic by simply taking a photo and storing all of them in a easy to navigate UI 
2. Use image-to-text conversion to make receipts searchable by store name, purchase date, or amount spent
